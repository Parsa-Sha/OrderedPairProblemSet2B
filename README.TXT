CONSIDER QUESTIONS ANSWERS:

1. 
a) Creating, or Instantiating, an OrderedPair object is done by typing: 
OrderedPair pairObj = new OrderedPair(4.0, -5.0);
However, this line of code does not include the details of the class

b) Creating an ordered pair while using only code works like this:
double x = 4.0, y = -5.0;

c) Printing an OrderedPair object gives this output:
OrderedPair@7d893421

d) This output gives what type of class is stored in the heap, 
as well as where it is located.


2.
a) It printed out the bvalues of x and y, seperated by a comma.

b) The "toString" method that is inherited from the default Object class is 
overwritten, and it instead prints out the values of x and y.
